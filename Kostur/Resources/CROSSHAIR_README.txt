CROSSHAIR IMAGE INSTRUCTIONS
============================

You need to create or download a crosshair image for the game cursor.

Option 1 - Create your own:
- Create a 32x32 or 64x64 PNG image with transparency
- Draw a simple crosshair (+ or X shape)
- Save it as: Resources/crosshair.png

Option 2 - Download:
- Find a free crosshair image online
- Make sure it's a PNG with transparency
- Save it as: Resources/crosshair.png

Option 3 - Use default cursor:
- If you don't have a crosshair image, the game will use the default system cursor
- The game will still work perfectly fine without a custom crosshair

Simple crosshair design suggestion:
- White or bright colored lines
- Transparent background
- Small dot in the center
- Cross shape with 4 lines extending from center
